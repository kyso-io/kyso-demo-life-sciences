## Mermaid diagrams for software & engineering teams

In this article we will showcase some example diagrams for different use cases on how technical teams can document their processes & workflows using Markdowna and the [Mermaid plugin](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid).

### Sequence Diagrams

A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.

Mermaid can render sequence diagrams.

:::mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Consumer-->API: Book something
    API-->BookingService: Start booking process
    break when the booking process fails
        API-->Consumer: show failure
    end
    API-->BillingService: Start billing process

### Class Diagrams

> "In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects." 

The class diagram is the main building block of object-oriented modeling. It is used for general conceptual modeling of the structure of the application, and for detailed modeling translating the models into programming code. Class diagrams can also be used for data modeling. The classes in a class diagram represent both the main elements, interactions in the application, and the classes to be programmed.

Mermaid can render class diagrams.

:::mermaid
classDiagram
    class BankAccount
    BankAccount : +String owner
    BankAccount : +Bigdecimal balance
    BankAccount : +deposit(amount)
    BankAccount : +withdrawal(amount)
:::

### State Diagrams

> "A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems. State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction." 

Mermaid can render state diagrams. The syntax tries to be compliant with the syntax used in plantUml as this will make it easier for users to share diagrams between mermaid and plantUml.


:::mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state fork_state <<fork>>
      [*] --> fork_state
      fork_state --> State2
      fork_state --> State3

      state join_state <<join>>
      State2 --> join_state
      State3 --> join_state
      join_state --> State4
      State4 --> [*]
:::


### Entity Relationship Diagram

> An entityâ€“relationship model (or ER model) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types). 


:::mermaid
erDiagram
    CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows
    CAR {
        string registrationNumber
        string make
        string model
    }
    PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is
    PERSON {
        string firstName
        string lastName
        int age
    }

<!-- ### Requirement Diagrams

A Requirement diagram provides a visualization for requirements and their connections, to each other and other documented elements. The modeling specs follow those defined by SysML v1.6.

:::mermaid
requirementDiagram

    requirement test_req {
    id: 1
    text: the test text.
    risk: high
    verifymethod: test
    }

    functionalRequirement test_req2 {
    id: 1.1
    text: the second test text.
    risk: low
    verifymethod: inspection
    }

    performanceRequirement test_req3 {
    id: 1.2
    text: the third test text.
    risk: medium
    verifymethod: demonstration
    }

    interfaceRequirement test_req4 {
    id: 1.2.1
    text: the fourth test text.
    risk: medium
    verifymethod: analysis
    }

    physicalRequirement test_req5 {
    id: 1.2.2
    text: the fifth test text.
    risk: medium
    verifymethod: analysis
    }

    designConstraint test_req6 {
    id: 1.2.3
    text: the sixth test text.
    risk: medium
    verifymethod: analysis
    }

    element test_entity {
    type: simulation
    }

    element test_entity2 {
    type: word doc
    docRef: reqs/test_entity
    }

    element test_entity3 {
    type: "test suite"
    docRef: github.com/all_the_tests
    }


    test_entity - satisfies -> test_req2
    test_req - traces -> test_req2
    test_req - contains -> test_req3
    test_req3 - contains -> test_req4
    test_req4 - derives -> test_req5
    test_req5 - refines -> test_req6
    test_entity3 - verifies -> test_req5
    test_req <- copies - test_entity2

### Gitgraph Diagrams

> A Git Graph is a pictorial representation of git commits and git actions(commands) on various branches.

These kind of diagram are particularly helpful to developers and devops teams to share their Git branching strategies. For example, it makes it easier to visualize how git flow works.

:::mermaid
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': true}} }%%
gitGraph
  commit id: "feat(api): ..."
  commit id: "a"
  commit id: "b"
  commit id: "fix(client): .extra long label.."
  branch c2
  commit id: "feat(modules): ..."
  commit id: "test(client): ..."
  checkout main
  commit id: "fix(api): ..."
  commit id: "ci: ..."
  branch b1
  commit
  branch b2
  commit
